# Real-Time 3D Simulation Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time 3D simulation powered by Socket.IO for real-time communication, Express.js for server-side logic, HTTP for data transfer, and React for the frontend interface. It simulates the tracking of aircraft in a 3D space, updating positions in real-time across clients connected to the same session. This setup is ideal for educational purposes, flight simulation training, or any application requiring real-time 3D visualization and interaction.

## Features

- **Real-Time Position Updates**: Aircraft positions are updated in real-time across all connected clients.
- **3D Visualization**: Utilizes CesiumJS for rendering 3D models and trajectories.
- **Responsive Interface**: Designed with React for flexibility and ease of use.
- **Server-Side Logic**: Implemented with Node.js and Express.js for handling client connections and data processing.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across modern browsers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. This project requires Node.js version 18.x or higher.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mastervishu/real-time-3d-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```
   cd real-time-3d-simulation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   This command starts both the backend server and the React development server.

### Running the Application

Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the 3D simulation interface where you can interact with the aircraft model.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can interact with the 3D simulation by moving the aircraft model around the screen. The model's position updates in real-time across all connected clients, demonstrating the power of Socket.IO for real-time communication.
